Speakability was an iOS application I developed for my final year project in university. The application was shortlisted at the [Big Chip Awards 2014] (http://www.bigchipawards.com/Shortlist2014) and most recently I sold the application to a leading university education agency in London - [Winning Education] (https://winningeducation.com). I am sad to see the application go, but its gone to a great home and I am now developing more apps including; Gradey and Domainey.
